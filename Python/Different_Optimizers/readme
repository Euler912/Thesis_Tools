Optimization Algorithms Comparison on California Housing DatasetThis project performs a comparative analysis of three different optimization algorithms—L-BFGS, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Manual Gradient Descent—applied to a Linear Regression model. The goal is to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset after performing statistical data cleaning and feature engineering.📄 Project OverviewThe workflow of the project is as follows:Data Loading: Importing the California Housing dataset.Preprocessing: Statistical outlier removal using Z-Scores and data standardization.Feature Selection: Using Mutual Information to select relevant features.Model Training: Training a Linear Regression model using three different optimization strategies.Evaluation: Comparing Mean Squared Error (MSE) and convergence speeds.📊 Dataset & PreprocessingThe project uses the California Housing dataset loaded via sklearn.Outlier Removal (Z-Score)To ensure the model is robust, outliers were removed using statistical analysis:Z-Score Calculation: The Z-score was computed for numerical columns to measure how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.Thresholding: A threshold of 1.5 was applied. Any row containing a value with a Z-score greater than 1.5 was considered an outlier and dropped from the dataset.Feature EngineeringMutual Information: mutual_info_regression was used to determine feature importance.Feature Dropping: Based on the analysis, the "AveRooms" and "Population" columns were dropped to reduce noise.Scaling: The data was standardized using StandardScaler to ensure efficient convergence for the optimization algorithms.🧠 Optimization Algorithms Implemented1.
